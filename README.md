## Brain-  
There have been studies that show an increase in brain growth. Music has shown an increase in memorization as well. Music can trigger an emotion which then triggers a memory. A study was made in 2014, where 89 dementia patients were put to listen to music for 10 weeks or sing for 10 weeks and the effect was **positive**. They seemed to remember some songs. 

## Mood- 
Different genres of music affect a person's mood. Even sad music can become beneficiary because it becomes an outlet to **vent**. Upbeat music can lift a person's mood. The lyrics can be relateable which helps people feel like they are not alone.

## Heart- 
Some surgeons have done open heart surgery while playing Mozart or other classical music and have noticed the patient recover quickly and the soft music allows the doctor to relax.

## Health- 
Music has helped people with health issues. Tourettes is widely known to be helped by singing. Stress and anxiety are common and music helps relax and calm.

# The Effect of Music on Plants
## Growth- 
Music is a stimuli recieved by a plant. Music releases vibrations that the plant cells can feel. Since the plants cells are moving, they stimulate the production of nutrients leading to an increase of height. Rock music is not ideal for plant growth even though rock music produces greater pressure on the plant cells. Classical music is better for plant growth because the pressure from the vibrations are stable.
